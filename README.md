# Customer Churn Analysis
I’m thrilled to share insights from my latest project, 𝐂𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫 𝐂𝐡𝐮𝐫𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬.
Throughout this analysis, understanding the reasons why customers leave and identifying patterns that can help predict and prevent churn. 

Typically, the analysis reveals that customer behavior plays a significant role. For example, customers who engage less frequently, spend less time on apps, or have fewer orders tend to show higher churn rates. Satisfaction scores are also crucial, as lower satisfaction usually correlates strongly with a higher likelihood of churn.

using classification techniques, the analysis can identify groups of customers at higher risk of leaving, allowing the business to take targeted actions. Regression models can help quantify how certain factors, like the number of complaints or days since the last order, influence the probability of churn.
